        <h3>THE SARS PROTESTS IN NIGERIA</h3>
        <img src="endsars.jpg" width="250" alt="End SARS image" />
        <p>
          The Special anti-robbery squad (SARS) is a special police force in
          Nigeria that was made to combat internet fraud in Nigeria but that is
          not exactly what they are doing. There have been a lot of cases in
          Nigeria about the misconduct and abuse of power by SARS officials. The
          SARS official profile Nigerian youths by accusing them of being “Yahoo
          Boys”, which basically means internet scammers, they target people who
          have iPhones, laptops, nice cars, dreadlocks, and so on. Not only do
          SARS officials profile the Nigerian youths for having basic amenities,
          but they are also harassed, assaulted, threatened, robbed, and
          sometimes even shot dead because they refuse to give their belongings
          to the officials. <br />
          This is a very important topic because a lot of innocent Nigerians are
          being murdered in broad daylight for refusing to hand over their
          belongings to corrupt police officers. <br />
          The Chief of Police in Nigeria stated that the SARS branch had been
          dissolved but the former SARS officers will be redeployed into the
          police force as a special unit basically creating the whole problem
          all over again. The Nigerian youths’ protests are trying to pass a
          message to the government that the entire police force in Nigeria
          needs to be reformed because there are a lot of corrupt police
          officers spread all over the force. There have been countless cases of
          police officers’ misconduct such as, extorting money from random
          civilians, assaulting civilians, making unlawful arrests, killing
          innocent civilians, and walking away without being prosecuted. The
          problems in the police force a rooted from the corrupt government in
          Nigeria. The police is so corrupt that even in the current protests
          they have beaten up a lot of innocent civilians, they opened fire at
          unarmed citizens leaving many injured and dead. Amidst all these
          events the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari has not said a word
          about anything. The problems in the police force are rooted from the
          corrupt government in Nigeria, the politicians in places of power in
          Nigeria steal a lot of government funds for themselves part of which
          is meant for paying the police officers. <br />
          In summary Nigerian citizens are asking for a reformation of the
          police force but the probability of this happening is very low because
          this isn’t the first time, they have asked for this and the corruption
          in the government has to go before these changes can be made. <br />

          This movie elucidates the story of the first female African president,
          Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The movie focuses on how she helped Liberia
          move forward after experiencing miserable times during the tenure of
          Charles Taylor. <br />
          Ellen appointed women in places of high power such as, chief of police
          and minister of finance. In this film Ellen showed that a woman can do
          everything a man can do and better. <br />
          Ellen inherited a weak economy from Charles Taylor including a lot of
          debt owed to other countries and a lot of issues in the country which
          included overcrowded streets, people living in graveyards and owed
          pensions to the military that fought for and against Charles Taylor.
          Ellen handled all these problems in a very effective manner from the
          way she provided a marketing center for the women that set up on the
          streets to the way she calmed a crowd of ex-military personnel. <br />
          The progress that Ellen made with Liberia was very impressive,
          considering the state Liberia was in when she came into power, even in
          the face of people who tried to bring her down with false accusation
          such as Edwin Snowe. Her progress was very much admired by other
          countries that the United States cancelled the debt that Liberia owed
          them, and China aided the country in their growth. <br />
          In conclusion, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf showed Africa that their
          stereotypes of women not being able to handle “a man’s job” are false.
